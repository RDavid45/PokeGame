Known issues - due to the randomness of how buildings are generated it is possible that a pokemart and center will
will try to be placed on the same section and if there is not enough space for both the center will be prioritized.

Assignment 1.01 - Pokemon board Generation.

genBoard(Board *b, int n, int s, int w, int e) - generates a board with set exit points. (redacted)

seedQueue is a queue used to hold the seeds of the terrain types used to grow terrain.

Assignment 1.02 - Pokemon World map Generation
---------------------------
Map has 7 functions:
5 movement functions: moveNorth(*m), moveEast(*m), moveSouth(*m), moveWest(*m) 
fly(*m, int x, int y) - moves to board[y][x]
initMap(*m) - sets position to 0,0 (200, 200) and generates the center board
printScreen(*m) - prints current position and the board
---------------------------
Assignment 1.03 - NPC movement costs 
---------------------------
MovementCosts has 3 functions to call:
initCost(MovementCosts *c, const Board *b) - sets the costs for each tile for all NPC types 
updateCosts(MovementCosts *c, const Board *b, int row, int col) - updates the min costs for each 
tile to reach a certain location (per NPC type)
printCosts(MovementCosts *c) - prints the costs of each tile for each NPC type 
Uses Dijkstras to calculate the min cost per tile. Dijkstras uses a generic heap that holds costNodes 
to find min.
